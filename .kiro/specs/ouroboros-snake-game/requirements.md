# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Ouroboros Snake Game is a modern, web-based evolution of the classic snake game, themed around the mythical Ouroboros serpent. Players begin as a simple hatchling and evolve through 10 distinct serpent forms, each with unique abilities, visual designs, and gameplay mechanics. The game culminates with the legendary Ouroboros form that can strategically consume its own tail. The experience emphasizes smooth gameplay, progressive evolution, strategic depth, and premium visual presentation.
